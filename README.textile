h1. NoteWiki

NoteWiki is a simple wiki system which uses "CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org as both the data store and to host the application. The design document for the application is managed using "couchapp":http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp. The wiki itself uses "textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ as the markup language, with a few wiki specific helpers (such as for WikiWords).  It uses CouchDB's native user authentication.  The CSS for the application is based on the lemonaid template by "smallpark studios":http://smallpark.org.
